			<h1>The Machine Learning Journey</h1>

			<h2> The objective </h2>
		<p> I have been learning a good deal of code over the past year while also studying for my undergraduate degree in keyboard performance from CMU. Now that I have spent some time in python, I realized that I was increasingly interested in machine learning. I decided to start the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/machine-learning-ai-engineering-foundations">Beta for the Engineering and Machine learning</a> foundation corse on Codecademy, where I have been studying my python and html, and I also decided to take a look at some actual AI's that were writing music. I discovered an AI called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiBM7-5hA6o">Deep Bach</a>, which writes chorales in the style of Bach Chorales, and I downloaded the source code with git from <a href="https://github.com/Ghadjeres/DeepBach">Ghadjeres github</a>. The initial problems I had with it were it's various mess-ups in terms of musical rules I had learned in my music studies, such as "no parallel fifths," "no weird modal interchanges," "no leaps of a tritone in any voice." I wondered if there were any serious problems that I could remedy by poking around in the source code, but once I downloaded it and got it to work, I realized that I was in way over my head. It was at this point, the day after my 26th birthday, that I decided to reach out to Umesh Madan. What follows below are the results of his shared knowledge.</p>

			<h3 id="9/7/22">Wednesday, September 7</h3>
			<p>		The most important thing I learned this weekend has to do with electrical current. From the Petzold, I learned that current is equal to the voltage divided by resistance. Current is measured in amps, voltage in volts, and resistance in ohms. This relationship can be represented with the equality "I &#x3d V &#xf7 &#937," where "I" represents current in amps, "V" represents voltage in volts, and "&#937" represents resistance in ohms. Current here represents the sheer number of electrons flowing past a given point, and I recall that one amp was equivalent to some mind bogglingly large number of electrons. From current, we can find the power in watts by simply multiplying the voltage times the current, as in "A &#x3d V &#xd7 I." <br>
					What is amazing to me about all of this is that I definitely studied this at some point in one of the two physics classes I took in high school, but for whatever reason, it never stuck. I find it so interesting that a concept that I have had a hard time understanding for so many years took one morning with a good explanation and proper study habits to firmly ingraine. I suspect that this project of systematic study of machine learning will also fill in a lot of the basic gaps left by my education, and I suspect that this improved comprehension will be useful far outside of this context! </p>

		<p> I just took a look at the pytorch tutorials, and they all seemed to be more than a little bit over my head. I noticed that they often mentioned the numpy library, and I got the impression that tensors in pytorch were pretty simlar to array's in numpy, so I decided to check it out. I will get a start on that tomorrow, but today, I am going to create a CSS file for this project so that the raw html isn't so horrible to look at. Still, I felt that I made a good deal of progress last night, because it looks like my DeepBach ai makes use of the pytorch library! I had not made that connection before, but now I see that I am on the right track. </p>

		<h2>Reflections on Code by Petzold</h2>
		<p>A few days ago I finally got a hold of my copy of Code by Petzold as per Umesh's suggestion, and I got a good start on it this weekend while I was camping. I was thrilled to discover that it started very simply, with descriptions of important codes, like Morse Code and Braille. While most of it was review, I was quite thrilled by a small chapter on electical current. I took two physics classes in high school, but I must not have been particularly industrious given the big gaps in my knowledge that still exist. One such gap that was very well filled with Code was my lack of comprehension of different variables relating to and affecting current. Given this, today's entry will be a reflection on these topics for the sake of memory.<br>
			For the sake of this week, my objectives are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Write a reflection on the current chapter in Petzold</li>
			<li>Get a start on pytorch tutorials</li>
			<li>Make Ubuntu disk image</li>
			<li>Install Ubuntu on friend's old laptop</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I feel justified in installing operating systems as an extension of this process because it contributes to my comprehension of the relevant systems, and I can use the machines with new operating systems to reduce my reliance on proprietary software.</p>

		<h2> Codecademy Django course </h2>
		<p>Today, I have been chugging through the course on Codecademy about developing a web application on Django. Here are some of the topics I covered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Javascript Syntax</li>
			<li>Stack Model</li>
			<li>Lamp Model</li>
		</ul>
		<p> This was quite useful for me today, because I don't think I ever really understood how valuable the LAMP model is to the modern world. After looking up <a href="#">this article</a> on wikipedia, I realize that the LAMP model is actually one of the most important underpinings of so many of the applications I use. This has also put some more wind in my sails regarding getting my server up and running. I think that now that I have spent some time away from that particular thing, the smartest thing to do would be to figure out a way to install a serve on a virtualbox on one of my old computers, rather than trying to erase the entire operating system and start from scratch. On Sunday, I think that I am going to try to set up Gesines's computer as a dual boot linux and windows machine without compromising the hard drive. I will also get Ges (Jes?) a new charger and a new battery.</p>
		<p> I also just found and watched an excellent video on how to install ubuntu server on a virtual machine on windows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MMqJH0ne-w">here</a>. I think that at some point I will sit down and do this on my windows partition of my macbook pro, to see how current it is. It would be excellent to be able to do that in a variety of operating systems.</p>

		<h2> Notes from the First Meeting</h2>
		<h3 id="8/23/22"> Tuesday, August 23, 2022</h3>
		<p>This is my first attempt at a reflection on a meeting. I remember that, in her wonderful book A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Barbara Oakley recommends re-writing one's notes the evening after taking them. Since I had my meeting with Umesh on Sunday, this is a bit too late for that, but I figure it is worthwhile to do so anyway. First, I will just make a list of everything I have written down. Then, I will break down each item. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and software</li>
			<li> Simulator</li>
			<li> How did we train language models </li>
			<li> Fine Tune vs shape data </li>

		</ul>
		<h5>Hyperlinks</h5>
		<p> Here is an unordered list of all of the hyperlinks he sent me in the chat that I have open. I have copied them in here so that I can close the tabs without having to go back to the teams meeting chat.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data Models in Python </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/">Pytorch Tutorials</a> </li>

			<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Zan560">Alexander Amini's Youtube channel</a> </li>
		</ul>

		<p>Okay, a lot of that doesn't make sense, and there is a great deal that I don't remember what it was about, but perhaps that will be okay. I think that the reflection will still be quite useful. My objective over the next couple of months is to just pick away at these subjects and try to organize the thoughts and materials with this webpage. That way, I can both keep track of what I am doing and learning, keep track of the materials, and show people everything I have learned.</p>
		
		<h5> The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </h5>
		<p> We started our discussion a little bit far away from the original topic. Originally, I wanted to talk to him about what I needed to know about modifying a machine learning algorithm called Deep Bach that I have been studying.</p>  
		<h2> My First Meeting with Umesh</h2>
		<h3 id="8/22/22">Monday, August 22, 2022</h3>
		<p> Umesh and I go way back. Way back when my mom was going to Reed College, her best friend was this wonderfully even keeled lady named Liz Hale. Umesh eventually married Liz, and so we have often gone to their wonderful house in Seattle. Umesh has always been trying to get me into computers, and he seemed more than a little bit dissapointed when I decided that I wanted to go into music when I started college. But, when the covid lockdowns happened and I lost all of my gigs, I suddenly became very interested in technolgoy out of necessity. Part way through finishing my degree at Colorado Mesa University, I decided I wanted to start learning to code. I had had a conversation with one of my girlfriend's family members, and he mentioned that he knew a lot of people who had used a python frameworkd called Django to make their own super slick websites. I decided that I would take a bit of time on Codecademy and work through their introductory python class. I was kind of just trying to develop my skillset and have a hobby, but the class started to take over a lot more of my time. I became increasingly interested in code, and opened up my world to command line scripting, markup languages, linux, and a dozen other interesting subjects. After about a year of code, I decided to reach out to Umesh about learning some stuff about machine learning, since he probably knows  more about that subject than just about anyone in the world. I have made this little static site in order to keep track of the instights he has given me, as well as to keep track of my own learning on the subject.</p>
