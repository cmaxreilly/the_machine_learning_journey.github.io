		<h1>The Machine Learning Journey</h1>

		<h2> The objective </h2>
		<p> I have been learning a good deal of code over the past year while also studying for my undergraduate degree in keyboard performance from CMU. Now that I have spent some time in python, I realized that I was increasingly interested in machine learning. I decided to start the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/machine-learning-ai-engineering-foundations">Beta for the Engineering and Machine learning</a> foundation corse on Codecademy, where I have been studying my python and html, and I also decided to take a look at some actual AI's that were writing music. I discovered an AI called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiBM7-5hA6o">Deep Bach</a>, which writes chorales in the style of Bach Chorales, and I downloaded the source code with git from <a href="https://github.com/Ghadjeres/DeepBach">Ghadjeres github</a>. The initial problems I had with it were it's various mess-ups in terms of musical rules I had learned in my music studies, such as "no parallel fifths," "no weird modal interchanges," "no leaps of a tritone in any voice." I wondered if there were any serious problems that I could remedy by poking around in the source code, but once I downloaded it and got it to work, I realized that I was in way over my head. It was at this point, the day after my 26th birthday, that I decided to reach out to Umesh Madan. What follows below are the results of his shared knowledge.</p>

		<h2> Codecademy Django course </h2>
		<p>Today, I have been chugging through the course on Codecademy about developing a web application on Django. Here are some of the topics I covered:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Javascript Syntax</li>
			<li>Stack Model</li>
			<li>Lamp Model</li>
		</ul>
		<p> This was quite useful for me today, because I don't think I ever really understood how valuable the LAMP model is to the modern world. After looking up <a href="#">this article</a> on wikipedia, I realize that the LAMP model is actually one of the most important underpinings of so many of the applications I use. This has also put some more wind in my sails regarding getting my server up and running. I think that now that I have spent some time away from that particular thing, the smartest thing to do would be to figure out a way to install a serve on a virtualbox on one of my old computers, rather than trying to erase the entire operating system and start from scratch. On Sunday, I think that I am going to try to set up Gesines's computer as a dual boot linux and windows machine without compromising the hard drive. I will also get Ges (Jes?) a new charger and a new battery.</p>

		<h2> The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </h2>
		<p></p>
		<h2> Notes from the First Meeting</h2>
		<h3> Tuesday, Auguest 23, 2022</h3>
		<p>This is my first attempt at a reflection on a meeting. I remember that, in her wonderful book A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Barbara Oakley recommends re-writing one's notes the evening after taking them. Since I had my meeting with Umesh on Sunday, this is a bit too late for that, but I figure it is worthwhile to do so anyway. First, I will just make a list of everything I have written down. Then, I will break down each item. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and software</li>
			<li> Simulator</li>
			<li> How did we train language models </li>
			<li> Fine Tune vs shape data </li>
			<li> pytorch </li>
			<li> Need to understand the training </li>
			<li> Need to understand the model parameters</li>
			<li> Andrew Ng class on AI on Coursera </li>
			<li> MIT's Intro to Deep Learning </li>
			<li> pytorch.org, do all of the tutorials </li>
			<li> Stanford Class on math </li>
			<li> num py </li>
			<li> Python stack </li>
			<li> pandas: Spreadsheets and models in python</li>
			<li> SK Learn: Libraries for machine learning,</li>
			<li> Backup has derivitaves </li>
			<li> Reinforcement </li>
			<li> Solomon Eich induction </li>
			<li> Cython </li>
			<li> C# </li>
			<li> Learn </li> 
			<li> Contract </li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Hyperlinks</h5>
		<p> Here is an unordered list of all of the hyperlinks he sent me in the chat that I have open. I have copied them in here so that I can close the tabs without having to go back to the teams meeting chat.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data Models in Python </a> </li>
			<li> <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/">Pytorch Tutorials</a> </li>

		</ul>

		<p>Okay, a lot of that doesn't make sense, and there is a great deal that I don't remember what it was about, but perhaps that will be okay. I think that the reflection will still be quite useful. My objective over the next couple of months is to just pick away at these subjects and try to organize the thoughts and materials with this webpage. That way, I can both keep track of what I am doing and learning, keep track of the materials, and show people everything I have learned.</p>
		
		<h5> The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software </h5>
		<p> We started our discussion a little bit far away from the original topic. Originally, I wanted to talk to him about what I needed to know about modifying a machine learning algorithm called Deep Bach that I have been studying.</p>  
		<h2> My First Meeting with Umesh</h2>
		<h3>Monday, August 22, 2022</h3>
		<p> Umesh and I go way back. Way back when my mom was going to Reed College, her best friend was this wonderfully even keeled lady named Liz Hale. Umesh eventually married Liz, and so we have often gone to their wonderful house in Seattle. Umesh has always been trying to get me into computers, and he seemed more than a little bit dissapointed when I decided that I wanted to go into music when I started college. But, when the covid lockdowns happened and I lost all of my gigs, I suddenly became very interested in technolgoy out of necessity. Part way through finishing my degree at Colorado Mesa University, I decided I wanted to start learning to code. I had had a conversation with one of my girlfriend's family members, and he mentioned that he knew a lot of people who had used a python frameworkd called Django to make their own super slick websites. I decided that I would take a bit of time on Codecademy and work through their introductory python class. I was kind of just trying to develop my skillset and have a hobby, but the class started to take over a lot more of my time. I became increasingly interested in code, and opened up my world to command line scripting, markup languages, linux, and a dozen other interesting subjects. After about a year of code, I decided to reach out to Umesh about learning some stuff about machine learning, since he probably knows  more about that subject than just about anyone in the world. I have made this little static site in order to keep track of the instights he has given me, as well as to keep track of my own learning on the subject.</p>
