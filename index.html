		<h3> Notes from the First Meeting</h3>
		<h4> Tuesday, Auguest 23, 2022</h4>
		<p>This is my first attempt at a reflection on a meeting. I remember that, in her wonderful book A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Barbara Oakley recommends re-writing one's notes the evening after taking them. Since I had my meeting with Umesh on Sunday, this is a bit too late for that, but I figure it is worthwhile to do so anyway. First, I will just make a list of everything I have written down. Then, I will break down each item. </p>

		<p>Okay, a lot of that doesn't make sense, and there is a great deal that I don't remember what it was about, but perhaps that will be okay. I think that the reflection will still be quite useful. My objective over the next couple of months is to just pick away at these subjects and try to organize the thoughts and materials with this webpage. That way, I can both keep track of what I am doing and learning, keep track of the materials, and show people everything I have learned.</p>

		<p> We got a bit off topic at the very beginning, so this book is a bit about 
		<h3> My First Meeting with Umesh</h3>
		<h4>Monday, August 22, 2022</h4>
		<p> Umesh and I go way back. Way back when my mom was going to Reed College, her best friend was this wonderfully even keeled lady named Liz Hale. Umesh eventually married Liz, and so we have often gone to their wonderful house in Seattle. Umesh has always been trying to get me into computers, and he seemed more than a little bit dissapointed when I decided that I wanted to go into music when I started college. But, when the covid lockdowns happened and I lost all of my gigs, I suddenly became very interested in technolgoy out of necessity. Part way through finishing my degree at Colorado Mesa University, I decided I wanted to start learning to code. I had had a conversation with one of my girlfriend's family members, and he mentioned that he knew a lot of people who had used a python frameworkd called Django to make their own super slick websites. I decided that I would take a bit of time on Codecademy and work through their introductory python class. I was kind of just trying to develop my skillset and have a hobby, but the class started to take over a lot more of my time. I became increasingly interested in code, and opened up my world to command line scripting, markup languages, linux, and a dozen other interesting subjects. After about a year of code, I decided to reach out to Umesh about learning some stuff about machine learning, since he probably knows  more about that subject than just about anyone in the world. I have made this little static site in order to keep track of the instights he has given me, as well as to keep track of my own learning on the subject.</p>
